## The Need

Students and early-career professionals looking to break into Product Management often find themselves overwhelmed by the A/PM recuiting process. Despite having a plethora of resources, established programs remain notoriously [competitive](https://blog.tryexponent.com/best-associate-product-manager-programs/), and there is immense pressure to spend countless hours preparing for these interviews.

## The Product

APM Map aims to be the one-stop destination for navigating the A/PM recruiting journey. Whether students are looking to better understand the role of a PM or refine their System Design interviewing skills for a technical round, we've curated resources across the entire A/PM recruiting timeline and created a community of professional A/PMs to provide the tools and guidance they'll need.

## The Tech

APM Map is an optimized web application built using Gatsby, React, Material UI and Framer Motion.
